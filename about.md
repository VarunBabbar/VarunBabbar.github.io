Hi! I'm Varun Babbar, a 22 year old taking his first steps into a career in data science. I recently graduated with Masters in Engineering (MEng) from the University of Cambridge, where I obtained a Distinction.

I'm really interested in quantitative analysis, mathematical modelling, machine learning, and statistics. I'm an incoming AI and Machine Learning Associate at JP Morgan, where I'll hopefully develop cutting edge ML techniques to solve hard computational problems (not necessarily in finance - this is a misconception about banks!)
\\
\\
I also love playing sports - any kind. In my life, I have played basketball, football, squash, tennis, badminton, table tennis, pickleball, rounders and engaged in swimming, rock climbing, and touch rugby. Out of everything I have played, I'm probably the most proficient at squash, followed by basketball. If you are in London and you want to have a game of pick up basketball or any racquet game, hit me up!

Another (fun?) fact: While I have lived in urban areas throughout my life, I find joy in spending time walking in the countryside and exploring picturesque landscapes. This is still a work in progress, but I have uploaded a few snapshots of some particularly beautiful countryside I have encountered across the world.
